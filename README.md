# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of the assignment was to analyze a rideshare app's (PyBer) performance based on city type; Urban, Suburban, and Rural. This specifican analysis looked at fares($) by week and city type.
## Analysis
First I created the table below to compare data from all city types. ![Dataframe](https://github.com/tori-taylor/PyBer_analysis/blob/main/DataFrame.PNG)
From here we can easily see that there are more rides in heavily popular areas (urban), more drivers in urban areas, but average fare per rider and average far per driver are the greatest in rural areas. Next I plotted total fares each week by city type. ![PyBer_fare_summary](https://github.com/tori-taylor/PyBer_analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)
Here we can see that even though their are dips and peaks in weekly fare, the urban city consistently has the highest total fare.
When I had an issue creating this analysis I used this code as reference. https://github.com/Dorislava/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb
## Recommendations
My suggestions would be to the CEO, is to first research some of the causes in discrepancies between fares. For example are the rural drivers making more money than the urban drivers because there is a surplus of Urban drivers, or is it just because the distrance driven by urban drivers is so small? They should invesitgate where rides aren't being furfilled or where there are long wait times to asses where more drivers could be needed. The CEO could then add more drivers. Since there were more drivers than rides in urban areas, I think we can assume there is more supply than demand in these areas. It looks like shorter distance fares are creating a smaller average fare per ride in urban areas, the CEO could increase the fare per km in urban areas.
